# PetalScript Langauge Support

This Visual Studio Code extension enables language support for the PetalScript DSL used for data aggregations on Saqura.io.

## Features

As of right now, this extension only supports syntax highlighting for the PetalScript language and provides a brand relevant icon package. This facilitates local development of PetalScript artifacts using a toolchain that is already set up and known.

## Requirements

This extension requires a Visual Studio Code installation with version `^1.75.0` to function properly.

## Known Issues

As of version `0.0.1`, the PetalScript extension does not feature a Language Server, which means that only syntactic highlighting is available without any auto completions or semantic help. This might change in the future.
